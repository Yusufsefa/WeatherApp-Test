In order to build this project, you will need to apply for your own API key from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api). 


## Build the project
 * Obtain your API key from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
 * Add the following attribute to your "gradle.properties" file using this format.
```groovy
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```
